# Development

## requirements

- go

### run mint

- `cd cmd/mint`

- `cp .env.example .env`

  you'll need to setup a lightning regtest environment with something like [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) and fill in the values in the .env file

- `go build -v -o mint mint.go`

- `./mint`

### wallet

- `cd cmd/nutw`
- `cp .env.example .env`

fill the values in .env file with the mint to connect to

- `go build -v -o nutw nutw.go`

# using the wallet

### check balance

`./nutw balance`

### create a lightning invoice to receive ecash

`./nutw mint 100`

this will get an invoice from the mint

```
invoice: lnbcrt100n1pjuvtdpp...
```

### redeem the ecash after paying the invoice

`./nutw mint --invoice lnbcrt100n1pjuvtdpp...`

### send tokens

`./nutw send 21`

### receive tokens

`./nutw receive cashuAeyJ0b2tlbiI6W3...`

### pay an invoice

'./nutw pay lnbc100n1pju35fedqqsp52xt3...`

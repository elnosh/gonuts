# Installation

With [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed, you can run the following command to install the wallet:

```
git clone https://github.com/elnosh/gonuts
cd gonuts
go install ./cmd/nutw/
```

To setup a mint for the wallet, create a `.env` file at ~/.gonuts/wallet/.env and setup your preferred mint.

## Using the wallet

### Check balance

```
nutw balance
```

### Create a Lightning invoice to receive ecash

```
nutw mint 100
```

This will get an invoice from the mint which you can then pay and use to mint new ecash.

```
invoice: lnbc100n1pja0w9pdqqx...
```

### Redeem the ecash after paying the invoice

```
nutw mint --invoice lnbc100n1pja0w9pdqqx...
```

### Send tokens

```
nutw send 21
```

This will generate a Cashu token that looks like this:

```
cashuAeyJ0b2tlbiI6W3sibW...
```

This is the ecash that you can then send to anyone.

### Receive tokens

```
nutw receive cashuAeyJ0b2tlbiI6W3...
```

### Request the mint to pay a Lightning invoice

```
nutw pay lnbc100n1pju35fedqqsp52xt3...
```

# Development

## Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### Wallet

- `cd cmd/nutw`
- create `.env` file and fill in the values
- `go build -v -o nutw nutw.go`

### Run mint

- `cd cmd/mint`
- you'll need to setup a lightning regtest environment with something like [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) and fill in the values in the `.env` file

- `go build -v -o mint mint.go`

- `./mint`
